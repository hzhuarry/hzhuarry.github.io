        Hello. My name is Harry Zhu and I am an aspiring computer scientist from New York City.
        I am a 1st Year student pursuing a BS in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
        I have skills in c++, java, html/css, matlab, and CAD software(Solidworks).
        I am versed in object-oriented programming and the application of data structures and algorithms.
        I have an interest in problem-solving by implementing algorithms.
        This is my website, and here, you will find some of my thoughts on various topics and personal projects.
        You will also find a hyperlink to my Github containing my personal endeavors, mostly my solutions in competitive programming, along with my linkedin profile.

        <h2>Computer Science</h2>


        <div class="inner">
            Computer science is the study of the theory behind interacting with data.
            It currently plays a major role in every facet of life and will only grow with time.
            When people think of computer science, they think of coding with programming languages, but it is much more than that.

            I would argue that “coding” has very little to do with computer science.
            The creation and application of algorithms is the foundation of computer science and involves logical reasoning and creative problem solving.
            Difficult problems highlight the ways to apply the knowledge available now, as well as how much we still have to learn.
            There are problems with no known polynomial-time, such as the traveling salesman problem, often called NP-hard.
            If these problems are solved efficiently, they intrinsically solve all other problems efficiently.
            Ultimately, computer science stretches the mind with abstract mathematical and logical concepts, and programming applies these concepts into a usable interface.

        <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
        <div class="inner">
            Competitive Programming is a mind-sport that utilizes algorithmic computer science.
            Competitions are mostly held online and are done individually.
            For me, the most interesting part of competitive programming is solving difficult problems using creative solutions.
            Time, efficiency, and accuracy are also all crucial factors needed in succeeding in this niche.
            Some sites which hold weekly or biweekly contests are Codeforces, AtCoder, and Codechef.
            Companies like Google and Facebook also hold annual contests such as the Google Code Jam and Facebook Hackercup.
            For college students such as myself, the International Collegiate Programming Contest(ICPC) is held at a regional and national level.
            I am drawn to the idea of thinking outside the box and pushing myself to gain more knowledge in order to represent my university at the ICPC as well as improve my own problem-solving skills.
